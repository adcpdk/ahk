# *ahk.sh*

 ISSUE: Unable to paste a number of users/groups in Bitbucket using Stash. Stash only accepts the first username and then waits an action from the user:

 "Enter" from the user 
OR 
 a "Click" on the name of the username.

 PURPOSE: This script generates a script for AutoHotKey software. Once ./type_enter.ahk is generated it can be used as a an autohotkey script.
 To run the .ahk script, just start it and you can use it by pressing "Win+V" combination.
