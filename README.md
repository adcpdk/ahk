# *ahk.sh*
# ISSUE: Unable to paste a number of users/groups in Bitbucket using Stash. stash only accepts the first user and then waits an "Enter" from the user
# or a "Click" on the name of the user.

# PURPOSE: This script generates a script for AutoHotKey software. Once ./type_enter.ahk is generated it can be used as a an autohotkey script.
# To run the .ahk script, just start it and you can use it by pressing "Win+V" combination.
